This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

🚀 Features Implemented
🎞 1. Dynamic Backgrounds Per Card

Each carousel card supports:

Video background (using react-native’s Video module via react-native-video‐like implementation using expo-av or native modules if required).

Image background (using ImageBackground)

Solid color background

Only built-in React Native APIs were used — no external UI or animation libraries.

🎨 2. Dynamic CTA Themes

CTAs automatically update per card.

Theme includes:

Dynamic button colors

Text color

Background tint

Theme changes are computed based on card metadata (e.g., gradient mapping, palette extraction, or static theme assignment).

✨ 3. Text Animations on First Entry

Each card triggers:
Fade-in
Slide-up
Animations only run the first time the card enters the viewport (tracked using internal visited-state logic and onScroll index detection).
No third-party animation libraries such as Reanimated, Moti, or Lottie.

⚡ 4. Smooth 60–120 FPS Scrolling

Optimized for performance with:
PureComponent / memoized components
useNativeDriver animations
Throttled scroll handlers
Lazy video loading (videos pause when off-screen)
Rendering only the nearest 1–2 cards
No layout thrashing
Heavy use of React.memo, useCallback, and useRef
Works smoothly even with high-resolution videos.

🛠 Tech Stack

React Native CLI / Expo (depending on variant)
JavaScript or TypeScript
No third-party libraries for UI, animations, or carousels
